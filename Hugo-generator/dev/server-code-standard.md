# Server code standard
-----

1. Business logic, Transactions, rules should be handled in the service code. (core-service)
2. API Interface should have documentation (javadocs)
3. SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe create new instances; don't make static.
4. For decimal numbers use BigDecimal and use valueOf to instantiate.
5. Make sure any new code is placed in the appropriate module. Be cautious of dependencies. 
6. External resources should be handled by a Manager that in-turn handles the life-cycle.
7. Use example query framework where possible. Keep custom queries to a minimum as this allow for greater flexibility as well as type safety on the query.  Which in turn make refactoring easier and reduces errors.
8. Beware of any potential infinite loops.
9. Pay attention to Transaction boundaries. For the most part it's automatic but, you can carrier over transaction where it's unintended. 
10. Prefer constants over hard coded strings. Keep constants with entity/object they relate to.  For general constants use OpenstorefrontConstant.
11. Focus comments on WHY (Business Rule) rather than HOW for internal comments.  The how should be clear from the code. 

## Entities

1. Entities should have all validation annotations marked and have documentation annotations as well.
2. Use 'get' and 'set' and not 'is' as there's a lot of automatic processing (reflection) on entities. Also, no need to add javadocs on getters and setters.  Unless there is special handling.
3. Most entities should extends the standard entity.
4. Preference is to keep model flat (meaning don't embedded complex classes)  If there is embedded entities, make to use Casacde, OneToX annotation.  Also, beware of db issues.  Note, the DB and moxy doesn't handling List of primatives (Meaning Boxed primatives) well.  Eg. List<String> should be List<EmailAddresses> 
5. Document Entities with @APIdocument to update the api docs.
6. Prefer composition of entities in view rather than inheritance. Use inheritance for substitutability.
7. All storage entities must be registered with the DB.  This automatic for class in the entity package of the api module.


## REST API

1. Avoid naming entity and view model fields (type or id).  It can break the serialization.
2. Use the API annotations to document the service. All REST interfaces need documentation as to purpose.
3. All consumed entities must have a root object.  Eg.  String (fail),  TextObject with a field String (Valid).
4. Response also needs a root object.  A GenericEntity can be used.
5. Resource endpoints map to entities where Services act on the system or are cross entities.
6. "Actions" supplement the API and are used for internal operations.  Also, they use to handle uploads as there's no JAX-RS standard for that.


## Cache Handling

1. All cache handling should be done in the Services rather than leaking it up a layer of abstraction
2. Beware to not modify cached version of the data.  There is a 'weak reference' to the object so it can end up applying unwanted changes.
3. All caches should be setup in the cache manager. 

## Logging

Each levels has a different audience. (See java Docs)  Add logging message appropriate for each level.   Focus on logging thing that would aid in debugging (When, What, the State was at the time of the error, and Data owner Eg. what component does it belong to)

*SEVERE* - System Admin and End-User; the operation failed; something prevent normal execution;  If throwing an Openstorefront error please state the error and note any thing that can be done to correct it.

*WARNING* - Potential Problems, System Admin or End-users, The system should be able to continue but desired effect may not have been achieved.

*INFO* - Message to System Admin usually for information about operation completed.  

*CONFIG* - messages are intended to provide a variety of static configuration information (Mainly initialization of a system stuff)

*FINE* - Debugging information for developers.

*FINER* - Detailed debugging information

*FINEST* - Trace message; highly detail.  If gathering the information is time consuming (CPU wise) then check logging level state first.  If (log.isLoggable(Level.FINEST)).

**If you don't add logging it not avaliable.**  So we need add logging where appropriate.  Typically, on anti-conditions.  
Think, "If I was troubleshooting this in production could I get enough information to solve an issue?" 
Log the data owner and state.
Note: Tomcat's loghandler doesn't seem to handle "{0}" substitution.  Use MessageFormat.format to handle that.

## Cross Cutting Concerns

**Security** - Make sure permission are applied to the REST/External API and UI features.

**Logging** - Security changes/sensitivity are must have an audit logging. (Log action, who performed it)

**Data Restriction** - Make sure data that should be restricted is and restricted at the appropriate level.  This is not applied universally, as there's complications that require specific handling.

**Change History** - Entries and Evaluations are supported. Log field changes, adds, removes...etc

**Alert** - Certain event must be track for administration alerts.

Use caution when modifying the code to keep these feature/requirements intact.
